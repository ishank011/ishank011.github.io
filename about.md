<p>Hello world! I'm <strong>Ishank Arora</strong>, a senior undergraduate at the <strong>Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi</strong>, majoring in <strong>Computer Science and Engineering</strong>. I am really passionate about software development and research, especially in the fields of <strong>statistical machine learning, deep learning and computational intelligence</strong>. I'm proficient at languages including <strong>C/C++, Python, Matlab, R and MySQL</strong>, and have worked with technologies such as <strong>TensorFlow, Keras, Django, BASH, Git, Android Studio, Adobe Photoshop, LaTeX and *nix</strong>.</p>

<p>According to Myers-Briggs, I'm an INTP - a logician, considered the most logically precise of all the personality types! When I'm not coding, I love to skate, play cricket and watch random episodes of Breaking Bad. Also, I'm all about quoting the appropriate references from my favourite movies.</p>

<p>KTHXBYE.</p>
